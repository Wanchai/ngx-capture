    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a
    horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown
    belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it
    and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest
    of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His
    room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A
    collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it
    there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded
    frame.
